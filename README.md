# Twitter Bot 

Currently it is estimated that around 15% of users on twitter can be bots. The bots help automate some tasks, but nowadays they are being used to modify trends on favor certain groups. As an example, the power struggle between political parties to favor a candidate and win elections. In this project, a basic search was made for a string of characters "AMLO" (Acronyms by which they refer to the current Mexican president) and from that result get the users and the number of tweets related to the string.
